# Beer & Natural Language Processing

Currently learning Python and Natrual Language Processing! Very excited to be delving into--and struggling somewhat with--this new project and language.

The goal of this project is to get an app that can read a social media post and retrieve information from it with a high level of confidence.

Have any tips for me? Shoot me an email! kasey.cushing@email.com
